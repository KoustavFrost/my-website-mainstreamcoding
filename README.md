History of changes done to my website:-
1. Fullscreen video background landing page.
2. Made the video optimised for quick loading but the quality was ruined.
3. Twitter link was added (@mainstreamfrost).
4. The video backfround was removed due to lag issue and responsiveness problem on phones.
5. Matrix Rain was added in place of the video background [Inspiration from : https://codepen.io/P3R0/pen/MwgoKv].
6. The webiste was optimised and made responsive for phones[Now works perfectly on any sized device and on webkit supported browsers.].
7. GitHub link was added.

Currently working on:-
1. The blog page by Mnak_256.

Future Plans[Priority List]:- 
1. Adding the "Currently Working on" stuffs.
2. Replacing the Matrix Rain with Snow using Patricle JS(only during winter).
